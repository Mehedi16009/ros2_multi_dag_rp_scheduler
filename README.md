# ReDAG$`^{\mathrm{\textbf{RT}}}`$: A Rate-Priority Executor for Multi-DAG Real-Time Execution in ROS 2

Author: Md Mehedi Hasan.<br>
Platform: ROS 2 Humble (Ubuntu 22.04).<br>
Artifact Type: Reproducible Research Artifact.<br>
Execution Environment: Docker (ARM64 and x86_64).

## Abstract

ReDAG$`^{\mathrm{\textbf{RT}}}`$ is a middleware-level scheduling framework for multi-DAG robotic workloads executing in ROS 2. Modern robotic systems frequently execute multiple independent Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) pipelines such as perception, planning, tracking, and control within a shared executor. The default ROS 2 executor model does not enforce a global priority hierarchy across DAG boundaries, which may introduce cross-DAG interference and response-time variability under load.

This artifact provides a structured executor-level scheduling framework and a fully reproducible evaluation environment to enable systematic investigation of multi-DAG scheduling behavior. The implementation includes a custom rate-aware executor, configurable concurrency control, soft-deadline instrumentation, and automated experimental pipelines.

The artifact is designed to support reproducible evaluation of middleware-level scheduling semantics in ROS 2.

---

## 1. Motivation

In ROS 2, callbacks from independent DAG pipelines are scheduled within a shared executor using FIFO ordering or thread availability semantics. No global rate-based priority hierarchy is enforced across DAG boundaries. Under moderate to high utilization, this may result in:
	•	Cross-DAG scheduling interference <br>
	•	Effective priority inversion across pipelines <br>
	•	Increased response-time variance <br>
	•	Degradation in deadline adherence

ReDAG$`^{\mathrm{\textbf{RT}}}`$ provides a structured scheduling abstraction to study these behaviors and evaluate alternative dispatch policies under controlled conditions.

---

## 2. Artifact Objectives

This artifact enables controlled investigation of: <br>
	1.	Cross-DAG interference in shared executors <br>
	2.	Effects of executor-level scheduling policies on response time <br>
	3.	Soft real-time deadline behavior under varying utilization <br> 
	4.	Sensitivity to thread count and per-DAG concurrency limits <br>
	5.	Reproducibility of scheduling experiments across platforms

The focus is executor-level scheduling semantics. Kernel-level real-time guarantees are outside the scope of this artifact.

---

## 3. System Overview

3.1 Execution Model

The workload consists of multiple independent DAG pipelines:
	•	Sensor DAG (e.g., LiDAR, Camera) <br>
	•	Perception / Detection DAG <br>
	•	Planning / Tracking DAG <br>
	•	Control DAG

Each DAG:
	•	Is composed of timer-triggered callbacks <br>
	•	Enforces internal precedence constraints <br>
	•	Shares a common ROS 2 executor

All callbacks compete at the executor dispatch layer.

---

3.2 RPExecutor Design

The custom executor introduces structured scheduling controls: <br>
	•	Per-DAG active callback limits <br>
	•	Rate-aware dispatch hierarchy <br>
	•	Soft-deadline tracking <br>
	•	EDF-style local dispatch within constrained execution regions <br>
	•	Explicit instrumentation hooks <br>
	•	Configurable thread pool size

Collected runtime metrics include:
	•	Per-callback response time <br>
	•	Deadline miss rate <br>
	•	Average and worst-case latency <br>
	•	Combined miss metrics <br>
	•	Thread utilization

The implementation isolates executor-level scheduling behavior from application logic to enable repeatable evaluation.

## 8. Evaluation Parameters

Key configurable parameters: <br>
	•	Thread pool size <br>

	•	Deadline scaling factor <br>
	•	Sensor timer periods <br>
	•	Instrumentation enable or disable

## 9. Experimental Scope and Limitations

Scope <br>
	•	Middleware-level scheduling behavior <br>
	•	Soft real-time performance evaluation <br>
	•	Executor-level interference analysis

Limitations <br>
	•	Docker-based execution introduces virtualization overhead <br>
	•	No kernel-level real-time scheduling enforcement <br>
	•	No formal schedulability proof <br>
	•	Evaluation limited to a single-host environment

This artifact does not claim hard real-time guarantees.

---

## 10. Expected Observations

Under increased concurrency: <br>
	•	The default executor exhibits higher response-time variance <br>
	•	Deadline miss rate increases with utilization <br>
	•	Executor configuration significantly impacts performance

The RPExecutor enables structured control over concurrency and systematic measurement of scheduling behavior.
