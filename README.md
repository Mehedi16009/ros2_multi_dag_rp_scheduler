## Abstract

ReDAG-RT is a middleware-level scheduling framework for multi-DAG robotic workloads executing in ROS 2. Modern robotic systems frequently execute multiple independent Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) pipelines such as perception, planning, tracking, and control within a shared executor. The default ROS 2 executor model does not enforce a global priority hierarchy across DAG boundaries, which may introduce cross-DAG interference and response-time variability under load.

This artifact provides a structured executor-level scheduling framework and a fully reproducible evaluation environment to enable systematic investigation of multi-DAG scheduling behavior. The implementation includes a custom rate-aware executor, configurable concurrency control, soft-deadline instrumentation, and automated experimental pipelines.

The artifact is designed to support reproducible evaluation of middleware-level scheduling semantics in ROS 2.

---

## 1. Motivation

In ROS 2, callbacks from independent DAG pipelines are scheduled within a shared executor using FIFO ordering or thread availability semantics. No global rate-based priority hierarchy is enforced across DAG boundaries. Under moderate to high utilization, this may result in:
	•	Cross-DAG scheduling interference
	•	Effective priority inversion across pipelines
	•	Increased response-time variance
	•	Degradation in deadline adherence

ReDAG-RT provides a structured scheduling abstraction to study these behaviors and evaluate alternative dispatch policies under controlled conditions.

---

## 2. Artifact Objectives

This artifact enables controlled investigation of:
	1.	Cross-DAG interference in shared executors
	2.	Effects of executor-level scheduling policies on response time
	3.	Soft real-time deadline behavior under varying utilization
	4.	Sensitivity to thread count and per-DAG concurrency limits
	5.	Reproducibility of scheduling experiments across platforms

The focus is executor-level scheduling semantics. Kernel-level real-time guarantees are outside the scope of this artifact.

---

## 3. System Overview

3.1 Execution Model

The workload consists of multiple independent DAG pipelines:
	•	Sensor DAG (e.g., LiDAR, Camera)
	•	Perception / Detection DAG
	•	Planning / Tracking DAG
	•	Control DAG

Each DAG:
	•	Is composed of timer-triggered callbacks
	•	Enforces internal precedence constraints
	•	Shares a common ROS 2 executor

All callbacks compete at the executor dispatch layer.

---

3.2 RPExecutor Design

The custom executor introduces structured scheduling controls:
	•	Per-DAG active callback limits
	•	Rate-aware dispatch hierarchy
	•	Soft-deadline tracking
	•	EDF-style local dispatch within constrained execution regions
	•	Explicit instrumentation hooks
	•	Configurable thread pool size

Collected runtime metrics include:
	•	Per-callback response time
	•	Deadline miss rate
	•	Average and worst-case latency
	•	Combined miss metrics
	•	Thread utilization

The implementation isolates executor-level scheduling behavior from application logic to enable repeatable evaluation.

5.2 Setup

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mehedi16009/ros2_multi_dag_rp_scheduler.git
cd ros2_multi_dag_rp_scheduler/rp_ws
```

Launch the ROS 2 Humble container:
```
docker run -it --rm \
  -v $PWD:/root/rp_ws \
  -w /root/rp_ws \
  arm64v8/ros:humble
```
Inside the container:
```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

## 6. Running the Workload

Default Execution
```
ros2 run multi_dag_demo multi_dag_demo_main
```

With RPExecutor Enabled:
```
export RP_EXECUTOR_MAX_ACTIVE_DAG1=3
export RP_EXECUTOR_MAX_ACTIVE_DAG2=5
ros2 run multi_dag_demo multi_dag_demo_main
```
Enable Runtime Instrumentation:
```
export RP_EXECUTOR_TRACE=1
ros2 run multi_dag_demo multi_dag_demo_main
```

## 7. Experimental Pipeline

The artifact includes automated evaluation phases:
```
Phase                  Description
Phase 12         High-load stress testing
Phase 15         Configuration sweep across parameters
Phase 16         Validation of best-performing configuration
```

---

Evaluation outputs include:
	•	Raw log traces
	•	Extracted metric tables
	•	Cross-configuration comparison tables
	•	Performance plots
	•	Summary statistics

All experiments can be re-executed using the scripts in the scripts/ directory.

---

## 8. Evaluation Parameters

Key configurable parameters:
	•	Thread pool size
	•	Per-DAG maximum active callbacks
	•	Deadline scaling factor
	•	Sensor timer periods
	•	Instrumentation enable or disable

These parameters enable systematic sensitivity analysis.

---

## 9. Experimental Scope and Limitations

Scope
	•	Middleware-level scheduling behavior
	•	Soft real-time performance evaluation
	•	Executor-level interference analysis

Limitations
	•	Docker-based execution introduces virtualization overhead
	•	No kernel-level real-time scheduling enforcement
	•	No formal schedulability proof
	•	Evaluation limited to a single-host environment

This artifact does not claim hard real-time guarantees.

---

## 10. Expected Observations

Under increased concurrency:
	•	The default executor exhibits higher response-time variance
	•	Deadline miss rate increases with utilization
	•	Executor configuration significantly impacts performance

The RPExecutor enables structured control over concurrency and systematic measurement of scheduling behavior.

---

## 11. Artifact Reproducibility Checklist

	•	Fixed ROS 2 distribution (Humble)
	•	Explicit build instructions
	•	Scripted experimental runs
